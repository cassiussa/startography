April 16, 2016 - Early AM.  I'm leaving off at a spot where the distance marker fade script has been put in place, but it is not functional yet.  Need to clean it up.  Also need to calculate the size of the circle for the distance markers to use in their LineRenderers' positions.


StarTography lets you to explore 3000 cubic light years of space with 3D navigation, data visualization, and more. Please see StarTography.net for more information.

This branch was created for the purpose of refactoring code and iterating to include additional and different functionality.
