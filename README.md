	The Common_Scale.xml file represents the States of the environment scale.  Essentially it is the layers that exist within any given frame, with the State being represented by the lowest layer number.  Visually, only current scale layer and higher layers (meaning farther distance) are active at any one time.  So a state is responsible for activating any child layers.
