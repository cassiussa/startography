####Version 2
I've begun to rewrite a lot of this code from scratch - again.  Hopefully have better coding conventions from the get-go

##What is StarTography
StarTography lets you to explore 3000 cubic light years of space with 3D navigation, data visualization, and more. Please see StarTography.net for more information.

##Notes
- 1 Unit = 1 megameter = 1,000 kilometer = 1,000,000 meter
- 10,000 Units = 10 gigameter = 10,000 megameter = 10,000,000 kilometers = 10,000,000,000 meters
